# HerHygiene
"HerHygiene:Empowering Women Together" is a mobile application developed to help women especially understand about menstrual and reproductive health.
# Inspiration
Women around the global are not fully aware about the various aspects related to menstrual hygiene and contraceptive health. This scenario is even worse in our country, India where women take themselves for granted. Even in my neighbourhood, mother of a year old infant was suffering from some postpartum complications but was hesitant to consult a doctor. So our app will help her understand such symptoms and act accordingly. Similarly,many women around the globe can take the benefit of our app around the globe.
# Technologies Used
We have used Dart language along with Flutter SDK framework to develop the app. Android Studio and its emulator have been used to test and preview the app screens. 
Canva and Figma have been used for the designing and wireframing of the app.
# Future Scope
We have thought of implementing the following in future:
1. We will add detailed information about reproductve health, family planning and contraception.
2. A special helpline number would be integrated which will connect the user to doctors where they can discuss their medical situation further.
3. We have also thought of having a personalised clinic tracking system, which will track the clinics in 10km radius around their area.
